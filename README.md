# Subtitles-Generation-multiple-language
This repository holds a treasure trove of transcriptions in various languages, waiting to be discovered.

To generate a README file for the provided Python script, you can outline the purpose of the script, its usage, dependencies, and any other relevant information. Here's a template README for your script:

Video Transcription Script
This Python script is designed to transcribe videos into text using the Whisper library and generate SRT files for subtitles. It chunks the video into smaller segments, transcribes each segment, and creates SRT files containing the transcriptions.

Installation
To use this script, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following dependencies:

moviepy
whisper-timestamped
difflib
You can install the dependencies using pip:

Copy code
pip install moviepy whisper-timestamped
Usage
Input Video: Provide the path to the video file as a command-line argument when running the script.
Copy code
python script.py input_video.mp4
Transcription: The script transcribes the video into text, segmenting it into chunks of specified duration and creating overlapping segments between chunks.

Output: SRT files are generated for each chunk, containing the transcriptions with timestamps.

Configuration
chunk_length: Duration (in seconds) of each video chunk.
overlap_buffer: Duration (in seconds) of overlap between chunks.
language: Language for transcription (e.g., "en" for English, "hi" for Hindi).
vad: Whether to use Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for segmentation.
overlap: Whether to generate overlapping segments between chunks.
confidence_threshold: Confidence threshold for word recognition.
Example
Copy code
python script.py example_video.mp4
Note
Ensure that your system has sufficient resources (CPU/GPU) to handle video processing and transcription tasks.
The script currently supports English and Hindi languages for transcription.
You can customize this README template according to your specific requirements and add more details as needed. Make sure to provide clear instructions for users to understand how to use the script effectively.
